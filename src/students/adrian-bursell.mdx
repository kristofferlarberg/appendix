With inspiration from childhood nature expeditions, I explore how design can highlight issues surrounding memory, place and identity.
The place I have chosen as the point of departure for my degree project is Öland, a place I have a strong personal connection to. I spent the majority of my childhood summers there and have developed a special relationship to its landscape and distinctive nature.
One aim of my project is to explore Öland’s material identity. Another is to investigate how a place’s character and identity can be expressively depicted in objects. By defining, collecting and transforming sticks and stones from Öland, I use these ‘souvenirs’ as decorative elements in furniture.
