Outdoor spaces around hospitals can be healing and rehabilitative, but they rarely are. Instead, you often find spatial structures with roofs and walls to shield from weather, made as designated smoking areas, in these environments. But where do you go if you don't smoke? 
I work with spaces and objects as part of the healing process, with the aim of creating a space for the patients' need for a change of scenery, protection and peace of mind. A space where people can temporarily relieve themselves from the anxiety caused by their illness, the sterile hospital environment and from the role of being a patient. I do this by activating our senses. I have developed four spatial experiences, and I arrange my objects in a yard at Karolinska Huddinge Hospital.
