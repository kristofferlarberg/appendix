Today, our kitchens have turned into a scenography of lifestyle with less focus on functionality and practicality. The food industry has made us careless, detached from the knowledge of where food comes from and how it is made. 

This project touches upon the history of the human species by exploring the process of baking, starting with wheat as a foundation for human settlement and civilisation.
The role of baking in our everyday lives has changed a lot since we embraced the urban way of living. The history of the communal bakehouse proves how important bread baking has been to us in the past but nowadays we have lost a lot of these communal spaces. I believe that a contemporary bakehouse could be a space where, through making and creating, we could share knowledge and experiences to re-learn about the processes of food.

By researching the Swedish rural folk interior and the kitchen of the welfare state, I investigate the aesthetics of baking and its needs. How can shapes and textures tell the story about a food making process? For this table I have been inspired by the dough itself, wanting it to reflect the stage of the baking process. Through creating engaging furniture, I want to connect us physically and visually to a more integrated and origin-aware relationship to food.
