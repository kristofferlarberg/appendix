Material diversity has its origin in questioning about how norms and standards are read. Although standards do not say anything about the diversity in materials used in architecture, there is a link where standard density goes up; material diversity goes down. Institutions have become so uniform that they ultimately belong to no one. Whether it is a hospital environment or a school, they have in common that surface materials are used rationally. Standards and efficiency are often perceived as synonymous, and in our world, rationality is valued higher than artistic ambition.
I experience a general loss of touch with materials in the architectural field at large and see how we use 2-dimensional images when choosing 3-dimensional materials. We give the eyes a superior status in relation to our other senses.

I want to highlight the status of surface materials as a way of communication in interior architecture. By using my body as a tool of measurement, I investigate the sensory qualities of the materials and explore the institutional environment. I test the materials and question the monoculture and its expanse.
