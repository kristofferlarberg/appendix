I was experimenting with the wall qualities, interested in ways that this border element, “one can also say” linear element, could become inclusive and spatial.
As a piece of background music helps us synchronize our togetherness, in a very inclusive way. I am trying through this component to synthesize in between the existent (nature of the space or place itself), and the intended quality of the activity. 
With that in mind, the importance of the design becomes not the object itself but what it does to the environment around it, and the experiences, it stages for users, who are invited into the focal point of the experience as the main protagonists in the spatial story.
