Nowadays moving images are one of the most common ways to share information.
It is also through photography, renderings and cinematography we see most of the
representations of architecture.

My choice of film as a medium relates to an ongoing discussion about how production of architecture is affected by the production of images. Shooting space is a
project where the potential of the camera is used as a tool to explore, question and
to challenge ideas about space, lived space, planned spaces and canonised space.

Film can be described as a sequence of two dimensional images that contains
shapes of light to mediate time passing. A description that sounds harmless. But it
is almost impossible to make a project about cinematography without reflecting on
the production of images as a very powerful tool. A tool where the production of
images easily can make intrusion on its motives.
One way for me to approach the camera from an architectural perspective was to
use the moving image as a tool for method development for production of space.

One other way was to investigate the importance of the placement of the camera
as something that is constructing the image in itself. In both cases, the idea of the
body as an architectural element and the space as an extension of bodies has been
explored in this project.

The result is a series of camera holders and a series of videos, through which I want
to share my questions about what the difference can be in terms of the placement of
the camera in relation to body and space. It becomes a way of both exploring and
exemplifying the problematics and capacity of image making in relation to architecture. With the videos and camera holders I want to highlight different ways to
represent architecture as something that is constantly in use and that is constantly
being made through our actions.
