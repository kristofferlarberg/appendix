In my project I have investigated the phenomenon of the sports cabin. An architectural movement and phenomenon based on the early 1900`s Swedish view on health and outdoor life that took us out in nature for a more healthy and active life, away from the city.

I have visited four different cabins, from the 30`s sports cabin to an ongoing construction of a contemporary summer house, to see how the idea of the movement have developed and if contact with nature is still a central part? By placing architecture in nature, we see nature, but how can we encounter it from the interior?

My goal with the project has been to create an interior that I lift out to the exterior to process contact with nature, how through various methods get in touch with nature through the elements. One way too show that an interior does not need to be experienced and be something static and to blur the boundaries of interior / exterior / nature.

In my proposal I present a sport cabin I’ve design from the inside and out, through define spatial interpretation of selected interior architectural elements and then let them create and support the architecture.
