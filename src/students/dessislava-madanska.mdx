A lockdown exhibition by Dessislava Madanska
Konstfack University of Arts, Crafts and Design-Degree project in Spatial Design
Stockholm, Sweden

As a part of my Master thesis in Spatial design at Konstfack, I’ve designed a series of objects for a contemplative/meditation space. Due to the Covid-19 lockdown I made each object from materials I had at home-such as pieces of cardboard that I painted in black, rope, duck tape, pieces of wood, marble samples, sponges, bricks, wood branches. With this discarded materials I created 7 objects-each exploring different material and each representing a different ritual.

The rituals are connected to fire, water, reflection. I decided to focus on rituals in our everyday mundane activities, rather than creating a new religion. To show how important routines are to keep us grounded, especially in times of crisis.

Each object has a different function and size. Spatially they develop on different  layers within the space-some are meant to hang on the wall, others to be placed on the floor or to develop vertically. A collection of functional sculptures.

To transform my apartment into an exhibition space I have wrapped the space with silver foil. This foil is in fact several emergency blankets-a material that you can find in some first-aid kits. A material that is reflective in itself reflects the objects and the candle light within the space. I have carefully wrapped the details in the room such as door handles or electricity sockets. As the material comes folded in a packed approx. 10 x 5cm when unfolded a pattern of the folds is created. My choice of material was also provoked by the possibility to reuse the material and by its connection to emergencies.
