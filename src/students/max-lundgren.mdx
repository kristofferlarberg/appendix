In a time when thrift is essential, standing structures offer hope – if we give them a second chance. As focus on care and preservation intensifies, arguments for demolition and reconstruction are on the decline. 

In my degree project, I develop a fictive design proposal for how Cementa’s concrete silos at Lövholmen in Stockholm could be converted into a public building. This proposal becomes an investigation into how urban relics could be given future application and thus saved from demolition. My interest circulates around existing character and potential functions and features. How the boundary between that which remains interacts with the potential of that which exists speculatively as a proposal for a lost building structure. And how spatial design has the power to make this possible because the professional role of the interior architect in these cases becomes primary.
