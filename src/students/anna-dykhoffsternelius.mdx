Competence and Performance are terms used in linguistics. They refer to the total knowledge one has of a language (competence) and how that knowledge is applied in communication (performance). The terms are also used in structuralist architecture theory, where competence refers to the possible interpretations of a design, performance to the actions that take place in it.

The project aims to highlight reciprocity in the relationship between user and space by exploring incomplete structures. The pattern as an incomplete structure - the possible endless repetition of a motif - has been the principle for my investigation, where I have wanted to identify and define other predictable and interpretable structures.

The site for my investigation is an empty ledge of a busy staircase on Kungsholmen in Stockholm. The structure of the staircase creates the ledge which suggests an original ambition but today it is empty, only passed by. This interactive installation is a temporary addition to the site.

The different components of the installation are defined by signals that suggest their relationship to the body, site and each other, rather than being defined by a specific function. In this way, the installation is not only open to interpretation, but dependent on it. It has a fundamental incompleteness that leaves it open; to change, to interpret, to define.
