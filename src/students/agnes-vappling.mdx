Attention constantly shifts. It shifts inwards and outwards. Attention attracts to that which is new and exciting. Then it lingers or dissipates in an instant. My work is an exploration of how intensifying certain qualities in spatial objects can stimulate sensorial attention in the user. By focusing on the context-sensitive relation between the low and high intensive, my ambition is not to force experience, but rather to provide it with emancipatory means.
