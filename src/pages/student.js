          <p>
            How do we create space? The most common tools used during the
            process are: pen, paper, ruler and computer. How do these tools
            control the outcome and how do they contribute to good communication
            in the different steps of a process? For example: What would be the
            outcome if we used our bodies as a tool to make architecture, and
            how would we communicate our ideas and processes? As an interior
            architect, I want to get closer to the user of spaces by paying
            attention to the distances relation between existing tools and the
            needs of the user. In my gradution project, I question our existing
            tools in both the creative phase and the communication phase.
