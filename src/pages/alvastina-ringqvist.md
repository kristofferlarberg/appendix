How do we create space? The most common tools used during the process are: pen, paper, ruler and computer. How do these tools control the outcome and how do they contribute to good communication in the different steps of a process? For example: What would be the outcome if we used our bodies as a tool to make architecture, and how would we communicate our ideas and processes? As an interior architect, I want to get closer to the user of spaces by paying attention to the distances relation between existing tools and the needs of the user. In my gradution project, I question our existing tools in both the creative phase and the communication phase.
