In my degree project, I have been absorbed by the stitch as action and the quilt as metaphor. Through patching and applications, I create textile images and objects, a sort of contemporary patchwork quilt evoking loss, care and neglect.

I collect materials during walks and while cycling, in my wardrobe and at flea markets. Sometimes the search becomes a hunt – a need arises and I require more of that specific blue quilted jacket fabric. I am inspired by the creativity that comes from need, to create from what I have on hand and in that place.

Sewing by hand is a slow process that requires time and commitment, something that gives me the opportunity to reflect over the conditions of my own surroundings. In sewing, I am allowed to consciously handle repairs and damage. Every stitch is a renegotiation of the fragments I sew together.
